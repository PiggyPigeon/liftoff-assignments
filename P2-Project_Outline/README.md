# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is called touchGrass. The way people and businesses get 
the word out about the events they are hosting is currently a 
series of disparate methods. They use individual websites, 
tiktok, IG, FB, MeetUp, physical posters, and word-of-mouth. This can make 
finding something to do and scheduling your interests a confusing and tiresome chore 
where you bounce between apps and scratch notes into your Google Calendar. 

touchGrass aims to fix this problem. We want to create a single place for users to 
1.) advertise their events and
2.) compile a list of events they are interested in.
touchGrass takes a users individualized list of local events and adds it to a personal calendar.

In the MVP version of touchGrass, users can scroll through a table of user-created local events and tick events they are interested 
in. From there, these events are added to their calendar. 

In the future, I would like this to become a swipe based app. Each event created becomes a card with event
descriptions and photos on it. Users swipe through events and indicate interest. Events they like are added to their calendar. 
Later, we can add features that alert users to overlaps in their event schedule. Also, we can create features that allow 
users to easily create cards for recurring events, private events (only shown to approved users), online events, etc. 


### Features
User Login: Users will be able to log in to their account to access their personalized calendar and master list of local events. 
Event Creation: Users will be able to add events to the master listing of local events for others users to view.
Search: Users will be able to search through the master list of events with a #tag system of interests.
Area search: mayyybe users will be able to search events based on their zipcode and a chosen radius. 


### Technologies
Java
SpringBoot
MySQL
Hibernate
Thymeleaf/Bootstrap
(whatever is required to make a persistent database into a calendar, probably mySQL)

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to figure out how to create persistent databases for individual 
users and how to display that in a calendar table while also allowing these users access to add to 
a database that all users have access to. 
Some of this will be a difficult review of the Coding Events instructional project, the Spa Menu user log in,
and some will be new. It will all be deeply confusing.
